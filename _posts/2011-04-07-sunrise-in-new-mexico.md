I was recently in Las Cruces, NM for two days for work. On the first day while driving in to the clients location, I was amazed with the beautiful sunrise over the San Andres Mountains. I left the hotel a little earlier the next day to make sure I could get at least one decent picture. The hard part about sunrises (and sunsets) is getting the full detail of the land. The sun will usually wash out all the detail of anything close to where you are taking your pictures. To compensate for this I tried to snap three pictures (-2, 0, 2 Exposure settings), then used my Hydra plugin in Aperture to combine all three picture for enhanced detail. This is also called HDR photography.
