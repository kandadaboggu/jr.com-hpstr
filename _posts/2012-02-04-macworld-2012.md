Wow, I can honestly say that this year’s Macworld was awesome!  The fans and sponsors were great, but I must give my biased applause towards the speakers and [MacIT Advisory Board][advisory-board] for their superb job on putting an IT conference together.

I was original assigned two sessions; one on iOS deployment and one on Lion Server, but I also had the chance for a third topic and co-present with [Ben Greisler][magikben] for what I called "[speaker bonus round][163343731775385600]".  I’m proud of this because the two of us were able to present professionally and I believe with value to the audience with less than 30mins of preparation time.  Definitely a test of knowledge and being able to stand up in front of a crowd.

Below are a couple of pictures I took with my iPhone 4S.  I think this is the first year that I never took my camera out of the bag, because I am really happy with the quality of my iPhone’s results.
